# PRODIGY_WD_01

I have created a Responsive Creative Agency Landing Page using HTML, CSS And JavaScript.

Through this project I have learnt HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, JavaScript to add interactivity such as changing the font color of the menu when a menu item is hovered Not only this, but also I have learnt how to stick the menu in a fixed position so when the page is scrolled the menu is always visible on the top and how to use AOS library of JavaScript to animate elements when scrolled up and down.
